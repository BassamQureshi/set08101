<p >
When baking a cheesecake , it is important not to over bake it . You only want to
bake it until the middle has a slight wiggle , not until it is rock solid .
</p >
<p > It is important that you use a water bath , discussed at the right , to ensure
even baking of your cheesecake . </p >
< aside >
To create a water bath , use a pan that will allow you to fill it with boiling water
that
goes halfway up the spring form pan in which the cake is placed .
